# Introduction to Wordlemon

Wordlemon is an app made in order to help pixelmon players solve their wordle requests using software instead of their brains. This app designed is primarily focused on [PokeWordle](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pokewordle) mode that is being used inside [minecraft pixelmon](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelmon) servers.

## Release 

This version of the project is tied to information that is provided within version [9.1.11](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pixelmon/files/5209074), so the results generated using this in version of Wordlemon who had been released previously or after this could be unpredictable and information may vary.
#### Note
Avoid using this in wordles that are not associated with Pixelmon, since the information about Pokemon inside different games are most likely not the same as they are in this project.
